This is my personal fork of https://github.com/andrelfpinto/vim-apdl. 

## Features:

* Syntax highlighting for ANSYS APDL files. (Nothing fancy, just comment, numbers and function names.)
* Indentation rules (*if, *elseif, *do, etc...)
* Autocompletetion of commands and elements

## To-Do

One of the ideas for future versions is to implement a command that calls the help *.html file of a specific command or element of Ansys.
